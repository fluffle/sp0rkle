Getting started, from scratch:

1) Install some dependencies and MANY version control systems.

sudo apt-get install build-essential bison mongodb libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install mercurial git bzr

2) Build go.

cd $HOME # do this in your home directory
hg clone -u release https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ go
cd go/src
./all.bash

# ... wait for compile ...

# consider putting these in ~/.bashrc too...
export GOROOT="$HOME/go"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"

3) Use goinstall to get dependencies.

goinstall github.com/fluffle/goirc/client
goinstall github.com/kuroneko/gosqlite3
goinstall github.com/skelterjohn/go-gb/gb
goinstall launchpad.net/mgo

4) Clone sp0rkle's code from github.

# Note: in order to submit patches more easily, you might want to get a github
# account, fork the bot, and clone from your own writeable version.

# If you do that, clone with:
git clone git@github.com:<username>/sp0rkle.git
# and then add my repository as an alternative remote to pull from:
git remote add -f -m fluffle http://github.com/fluffle/sp0rkle.git

# Otherwise, just clone from my repository:
git clone http://github.com/fluffle/sp0rkle.git

5) Import the old factoid database into mongo:

gb  # build things
bin/factimporter --db=/path/to/db

# If you don't know where to get the db, you shouldn't be submitting patches :-)

6) Code, build, commit, push :)

while coding:
  vim <stuff>:wq
  gb  # build
  bin/sp0rkle --host irc.pl0rt.org --port 6697 --ssl  [--nick=mybot] [--channel='#test']  #run
  ^C

git add <stuff>
git commit -m "Some useful message about the edit to <stuff>."

# If you cloned from your own repo:
git push  # pushes changes in your branches up to github
# ... then send me a pull request on github :-)

# Otherwise, I guess you'll have to mail me a patch, or something:
# This might work, untested, you should read man git-format-patch(1).
git format-patch --attach --stdout --to=abramley@gmail.com | mail
